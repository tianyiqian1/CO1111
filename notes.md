# Notes

<!--

copy from assignment: A “notes.html” or “notes.md” page where you log your progress in the project. Ideally you will
have weekly (or more frequent) entries, explaining what you worked on since the previous
meeting, and short descriptions of what individual members worked on.
A teamwork minutes (notes) page which shows evidence of your teamwork. At the very
minimum you need to have:
 A brief description of the team members and their roles,
 Minutes (i.e. notes) for at least 5 meetings or progress reports.
