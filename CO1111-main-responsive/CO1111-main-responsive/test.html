<!--

copy from assignment: A “test.html” page which provides a description of your testing efforts. This page can be linked
from “index.html” or not (your choice). Even though this page does not need to be particularly
nice, it should still be usable and present your work in a meaningful and academically
appropriate way.
You develop a testing page which includes notes of your testing efforts. At the very minimum
you need to have:
 A Unit Test for some aspect of your Web App,
 A User Acceptance test plan detailing the scenarios in which you test the app, along
with the results,
 A basic usability assessment of the final app (e.g. using Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics).
